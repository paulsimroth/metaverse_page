# Next.js Metaverse
I followed this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCN_gynFYw&t=5873s) to familiarize myself with Next.js and Tailwindcss. This project is my first introduction to those two tools.
The animations are done with Framer Motion. This is also my first introduction to this tool. 
It is a landing page for a metaverse.
