# Next.js Metaverse
I followed this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCN_gynFYw&t=5873s) to familiarize myself with Next.js and Tailwindcss. This project is my first introduction to those two tools.
The animations are done with Framer Motion. This is also my first introduction to this tool. 
It is a landing page for a metaverse.

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Javascript (NextJS & Testing)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
