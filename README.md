# Next.js Metaverse
I made this Metaverse to familiarize myself with Next.js and Tailwindcss. This project is my first introduction to those two tools.
The animations are done with Framer Motion. This is also my first introduction to this tool. 

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Javascript (NextJS & Testing)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Styling)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Animations)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
